The concept involves using the OpenCV library along with the cvzone module for hand tracking. The program captures video frames from the webcam, tracks the user's hand, and interprets specific hand gestures to control the presentation. The gestures include swiping left or right to change slides and using the index finger to draw annotations on the current slide.

Features:
1) Real time hand tracking using openCV
2) Gesture recognition
3) Slide navigation and annotation
